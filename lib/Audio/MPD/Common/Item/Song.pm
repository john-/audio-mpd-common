# -- public methods

=method as_string

    my $str = $song->as_string( [$format] );

Return a string representing $song. If C<$format> is specified, use it
to format the string. Otherwise, the string returned will be:

=over 4

=item either "album = track = artist = title"

=item or "artist = title"

=item or "title"

=item or "file"

=back

(in this order), depending on the existing tags of the song. The last
possibility always exist of course, since it's a path.

This method is also used to automatically stringify the C<$song>.

B<WARNING:> the format codes are not yet definitive and may be subject
to change!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Audio::MPD::Common::Item::Song> is more a placeholder with some
attributes. Those attributes are taken from the song tags, so some of
them can be empty depending on the file.

The constructor should only be called by L<Audio::MPD::Common::Item>'s
constructor.
